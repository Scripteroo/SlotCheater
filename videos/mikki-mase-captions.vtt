00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
They're called slot hustlers. There's guys full time for a living. They have a system.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You ever seen the dude that is on one of those riding around and he's putting bets around? You're just like, you're just betting,

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Slot hustlers have a system. And they found a way to calculate like, what he's saying when it hits the threshold of when it will become profitable.

4
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So they're always with the slot hustlers, the real guys, the pros. They know when to sit in a machine when it's in that certain range.

5
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So they're like, within X amount roughly spins, I'm guaranteed this jackpot. 

6
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Yeah. But so you're telling me, if the jackpots at 130 grand,
he goes all right, as long as I blow 120 to make 10, I'm good. 

7
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Well, well, basically the idea is much simpler. As far as dollars go.
Like he could be like I can for the next 10 spins, at $100 a spin, I'm guarantee, almost guaranteed, one of these 10 spins, again,

8
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And the jackpot, that it can be with that kind of range, I thought you have to be like, All right, it's 130 I'll invest 100 grand into this machine,
and hopefully I went 30. But you're telling me they can pull it off within 10 spins. 

9
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Yeah, there's really sharp guys out there.
